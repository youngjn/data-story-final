			<h1 class="title">More We Eat Meat</h1>

			<p>For me, if someone asks me what my favourite cuisine is, I can not answer since there are so many. However, in terms of ingredients, not the cuisine, I would definitely say meat. Just like me, itâ€™s really hard to find who does not love meat. We can see how people think and treat meat by looking at the chart of the global meat production.</p>

			<p>In this chart, the global meat production has been increasing gradually <span class="red">from 1998 to 2018.</span> The amount of meat produced around the world, has increased <span class="red">150%</span> in last 20 years as you can see. People want and crave meat more and more. </p><p>All countries around the world produce meat. But for few countries, they produce way more than other countries. <span class="red">Especially China and U.S.A,</span> because of their economy growth and population, they produce almost half of the world's meat production.

					<p>Some people may think that the production process of meat will be simple and easy. In fact, it is true that it is relatively easier than other food products, but the production process of meat also takes several steps. Below, the production process of meat is written in order with explanation.

			<p>The biggest issue with meat production is GreenHouse Gas emissions which is also known as GHG Emission. GreenHouse Gases trap heat from escaping so that the heat comes back naturally and it warms the planet again and again. So if GreenHouse Gas emissions increase, it means the temperature of the earth can increase too, and we all know that if the temperature goes up, that is not a good sign. Every step in meat production has some related task with this GreenHouse Gas. Because of the increase of GHG emissions, last 200 years, the temperature of the planet has increased by 1.0 Celsius. The main gases responsible for the greenhouse effect include <span class="red">carbon dioxide</span>, <span class="red">methane</span>, <span class="red">nitrous oxide</span>, and water vapor (which all occur naturally), and <span class="red">fluorinated gases</span> (which are synthetic).

			<p>Until this point, I was talking about general meat, including poultry meat, such as chicken or duck, pork, and beef. Now it is time to separate them each other. In terms of production, different types of meat production made different impact on GHG. It's also really interesting that how they are so different with their GreenHouse Gas emissions during their process of production. Each kilogram, beef emits the most amount of GHG. Since the amount of beef production is the largest every year among those three types of meat, it definitely has the biggest impact on this planet.

			<p>Some people argue that not having meat is good for our planet. And now it is proved that it actually helps our planet. Vegans participated in this practice. However, if you love meat just like me, you can still reduce your amount of consumption in your daily life. Instead of meat, we can satisfy our daily protein needs also from foods like tofu, egg, and beans, etc. As much as I love meat, I also love this beautiful planet. I strongly believe that there should be something you can give up for the sake of loving.
